# OpenSCAD 3D Print Design Files

The following are my OpenSCAD-based project files for 3D models that I have
designed. Some of these are works in progress.

## Eight Bit Switch Module

As part of an in-progress (perhaps perpetually) project to build my own 8-bit
computer platform, I plan to develop a set of 3D printed front-panel modules
along with a frame for holding them.  This is the first module I am working on
which will be a basic 8-bit switch module for an input port.

## Ikea Table Leg Sleeve

This is a compression sleeve to repair broken adjustable legs on a basic Ikea
table. Apparently, the adjustable legs eventually break to the point where they
will no longer stay extended.  These sleeves can be used to repair these legs.
This design has also been [published on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/297085-ikea-table-adjustable-leg-repair-sleeve).

## Project Box

This is an electronics project box with lid that uses inserts for securing
the lid.  Like all the OpenSCAD designs on this site, the source file is
parameterized so the box dimensions can be customized as needed.

## ROM Emulator Case

This is a custom case for the [EPROM Emulator](https://mygeekyhobby.com/2020/07/05/eprom-emulator/)
created by Kris Sekula at [My Geeky Hobby](https://mygeekyhobby.com/about/).
The dimensions are based on version v1.9 (Jan-2022) of his emulator and is
designed to not require the PCB to be removed from the 3D printed base plate
that Kris provides. OpenSCAD design files
are proided. This design has also been published on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/379508-eprom-emulator-case) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5810817).

## Self-Stacking Tarot Boxes

These are self-stacking boxes designed to hold tarot card decks in a uniform
way to help organize my collection of decks.  I was frustrated by the vast
variation in tarot deck dimensions which made it hard to organize them in an
anal retentive way on my shelf. So, these boxes provide standard dimensions and
also serve to protect the decks themselves.  This is sort of still a work in 
progress.  Eentually, I hope to have a web site that will allow folks to
customize them as needed more easily than editing the soruce files. Also, I
would like to add printable inserts for specific decks that hold them in 
place inside the box.  THe boxes are designed to stack in an interlocking way
with a lid then on the top-most box of the stock.

## Tall Box with Lid

This is a box designed to hold card decks upright and came out of the need
for some way to carry 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragon spell and magic item
cards to my periodic games with friends. It is still a work in progress as
I want to use detents to hold the lid closed as opposed to the rubber bands
which I now use.
