# ROM Emulator Case

The files contained here are for a 3D printed case for the [MyGeekyHobby EPROM Emulator](https://mygeekyhobby.com/2020/07/05/eprom-emulator/). The design philosophy behind this case was to provide an easily printable case which would work with an unmodified EPROM Emulator.  One should be able to simply take the assembled emulator as supplied by MyGeekyHobby, place it into the case, and screw down the lid.  The lid is designed with two button extensions for the Reset button on the Arduino and the Load button on the emulator board.  Light pipes are provided so the state of the Power and Run LEDs can still be observed.

To print the case, the base box, lid, and two light tubes are all separately printed.  Four 5mm or 6mm [M2 threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YFQ1H5J) are then pressed into the corners of the base box ([YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6OBlSzp7I)). Cyanoacrylate glue (SuperGlue, Krazy Glue, etc.) is then lightly used to afix the light tubes into their two holes on the lid.  Then four 12mm [M2 hex bolts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F75DMHF) are used to screw the lid into place with the button extensions and light tubes going over the buttons and LEDs on the EPROM Emulator board.  Tabs on the lid itself secure the EPROM Emulator board securely to the bottom of the base box.  The ribbon cable extends out of the box through the ribbon cable cutout and the USB cable can still be attached to the Arduino through the provided porthole in the base box.

The designs were created using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) and the original OpenSCAD source files are provided.  Files are provided for the box, lid, and light tubes.  In addition, a library file is provided for the captured shaft button.  The button extension design is such that the button is printed in placewith a design that captures the shaft of the button.  There is a commented out line in the CapturedShaft.scad source file which if uncommented can be used to print a cross-section of the captured shaft button to demonstrate its design.

The prints were completed on my Prusa i3 MK3S+ printer. Standard 1.75mm PLA filament was used.  Any color certainly could be used for the box and lid.  Transparent PLA filament is used to print the two light tubes.  I used a [generic transparent filament from Geeetech](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SS3CV8J) purchased from Amazon and had no problems.  Although, normally I always splurge and use [Prusament-brand filament](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/prusament-pla/). I will note that I always use [Aqua Net](https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Net-Extra-Professional-Unscented/dp/B00E4MQIBU?th=1) as a sticking agent on my print bed sheets.  In addition to STL files, this repository also has 3MF files from PrusaSlicer and the provided GCODE is from PrusaSlicer for the MK3S+ printer.
